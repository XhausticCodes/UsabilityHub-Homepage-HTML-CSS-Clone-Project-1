6-10-24: 
Made it responsive by using flex, Media Query and little bit of JS functionalities.
Added a New Navigation button with JS.

7-10-24:
Updated a small transfrom effect at examples-card div, when hovering the card pops up.
(Wasn't a Big Update tho)

9-10-24:
Added a new Toggle button for Dark/Light theme - used little bit of js (i got no clue, gonna complete js very soon), But the code worked anyway.
Slight changes on examples-card hover property.
This Code need to be modified, some of the button are not aligned and the color texture is sh*t in dark theme.

13-10-24:
Added Glowing effect on Toggle Button using CSS.

Please Contribute and add functionalities to it.
